You have two on-chain registries powering the dashboard:

Audit Registry
This contract holds a list of every audit submitted, each represented by an NFT and an IPFS link. Every audit record includes the ID of the report-NFT, the auditor’s wallet address, the audited contract address, the exact timestamp of submission (in milliseconds), plus four pieces of human-friendly metadata: the auditor’s role title, their displayed name, an optional link to their personal website or profile, and a “verified” flag (together with who did the verification). Only addresses that an owner-controlled list has marked as verified may add new audits. Whenever an audit is added, an event fires so you can broadcast updates in real time.

User Role Registry
This contract maintains public profiles for any participant in the system—auditor, developer, or otherwise. Each profile ties a wallet address to a declared role, a chosen display name, and an optional link. Profiles start out unverified; the registry’s deployer (owner) can flip a verified flag on any address, recording who approved it and when. It also emits an event on every new verification, so the frontend can highlight newly approved users immediately.

On the dashboard, you will present two main views:

Audit Feed
A continuously updated list of all audits from the audit registry. Each entry shows the target contract address, the date-and-time when the audit was recorded, the auditor’s display name (linked out to their profile), the role they claimed, and a little badge if they’re verified. There’s also a direct link to download or view the NFT report from IPFS. Only verified auditors can appear here; unverified attempts are impossible by design.

Verified User Directory
A directory of every address the owner has blessed in the user role registry. Each user card displays their role title, display name, and profile link. A “verified” checkmark shows that the owner has approved this identity, and clicking on a card could reveal more contact or credential links (email, Discord handle, Zoom link, or credential URL) if they’ve opted to share them.
